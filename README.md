## 🚀 About Me
I am an aspiring DevOps engineer with a background in sales, customer service, and data analysis. Currently studying **Statistics & Data Analysis** at Linköping University, I enjoy working with cloud technologies, automation, and data-driven decision-making.

My previous roles in real estate consulting, B2B sales, and customer support helped me develop strong analytical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills—abilities I now apply toward DevOps, cloud tooling, and scripting.
